Nethunter AP

This eviltwin script lets you run a fake access point portal with handshake verification using a virtually created wlan1 on Kali Nethunter. You only need one external adapter for deauthing the original network.

Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dr1408/nethunter_ap.git
cd nethunter_ap
```

Plug in your wireless adapter

```bash
./evil.sh
```
